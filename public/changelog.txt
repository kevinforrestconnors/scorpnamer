Bugfixes
  - Fixed a bug where "isMono" was comparing color names (which can collide if hex code is not an exact match) instead of hex codes.
Major
  - Added a second color naming library with better color names.  This should particulary improve the mono scorpion naming experience.
  - Added name lists for: [syringe_tails, fat_tails, ball_tails, stubby_legs, skinny_legs, insect_legs, fat_legs]
  - Added some longer names and if the name generator creates a name > 64 characters, it will reroll the name (you will notice no difference, but 64 characters is the max for official names through transactions, so didn't want to give a name that can't be used.)
  - Adjusted rarity so that 2 prefix / 2 suffix is more rare (was 33.3%/33.3%/33.3% 0/1/2 affixes, now 30%/60%/10% 0/1/2 affixes)
Minor
  - Added more names to the "smokers" name list 
  - Added more names to the "ballers" name list
  - Added more names to the "druglords" name list
  - Added more names to the "mushrooms" name list
  - Added more names to the "edwards" name list
  - Added more names to the "monos" name list

Major
  - Clicking color distribution colors now opens a pane that shows all scorpions with that color
  - Colors with names like "sea green" or "seagreen" are now converted to e.g. "sea" by stripping away the names:
    > [black, blue, cyan, green, teal, turquoise, indigo, gray, purple, brown, tan, violet, beige, fuchsia, gold, magenta, orange, pink, red, white, yellow]
  - Removed ntc library since color-namer already uses it.
  - Lots of misc. style changes
Minor
  - Added a small list of German names
  - Added 693 names from https://babynames.com/names/popular/around-the-world.php
  - Suffixes now have a 15% chance to be changed to "the {suffix}", but only for one of the suffixes
  - Added a few more names to some categories
Bugfix
  - name could end in "the"
